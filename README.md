# Emotional Flower Garden

Record your feelings, one line a day. 
Your emotions will gather and bloom your own.

## Infomation

Emotional_FlowerGarden is a project of team UNI who participated in Solution Challenge Hackathon.
People easily become depressed because in recent years there has been little interaction between people and the emotional clot has not been resolved.
How can I get rid of this clot? The Flower Garden project, which began to resolve emotions, talks with birds visiting the garden, relieves the feelings of the day and leaves feelings in the diary. It is an application that blooms the garden with the feelings of the day.
